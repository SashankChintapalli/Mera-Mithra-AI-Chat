### Personal Notes

This project demonstrates the interaction between users and an AI model in a simple yet effective way. The inclusion of a stop button improves user control, and the save feature adds practical usability. Future improvements could include enhancing UI/UX, adding multi-turn conversation history, and implementing different AI model choices.
